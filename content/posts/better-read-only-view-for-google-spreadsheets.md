If you need read only access to a google docs spreadsheet it's much faster and easier to use an exported version. Just go to File > Download As > Web Page and it'll open a new window with the fully loaded spreadsheet.

Here's a [public spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ajf-Cys1JrC9dHpmQjNtakpVdW9yLVpsR0xWT1FYenc&usp=sharing) if you want to try it out.
