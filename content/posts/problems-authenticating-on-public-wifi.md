At Starbucks or McDonalds, on airplanes, at libraries or anywhere else they have free wifi you get popups asking you to accept terms and conditions and click a \[Connect Now\] button.

If you ever have problems getting these screens to display it's almost certainly because you're using non-default DNS servers. The solution for me was to go to System Preferences > Network and create a new Location called "Default DNS".
