Common issues caused by bonjour with [Teleport](abyssoft.com/software/teleport):

- Teleport not connecting
- Teleport not showing the accept prompt
- Teleport only able to connect in one direction and not the other
- Teleport can't reconnect

### Making sure Bonjour is working

1. Messages.app > Preferences > Accounts > Bonjour > Enable Bonjour instant messaging (on both computers)
1. Locate your other computer in the buddy list (âŒ˜1) and send a message between computers.
1. Disable Teleport on both computers
1. Restart both computers (sorry)
1. Enable Teleport on both computers and hopefully connect
