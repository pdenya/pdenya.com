title: Disabling the save shortcut for browsers

The save hotkey in Chrome needs to be changed for all the same reasons I [disabled the Print hotkey](/2013/07/23/disabling-the-print-hotkey-in-os-x/). I hit it by accident a few times a week thinking some other application is active and then I have to wait for it to load to get out of it. It's only a few seconds but it's an easily fixed annoyance.

## The Fix

Changing the Save hotkey for Chrome is pretty simple and it'll work similarly for other browsers. Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts. Add custom shortcuts for:

- Click the plus sign
- Application: Google Chrome
- Menu Title: File->Save Page As...
- Keyboard Shortcut: I used ⇧⌘S
