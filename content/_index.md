Over the past **15+ years** I've delivered software projects for small startups, established businesses, and major brands.

**Nowadays I architect AI systems and build products for early-stage startups** including PressFriendly, the one I co-founded.

**I prefer to work with Ruby and React** but i've also worked professionally in Javascript/Typescript, PHP, Python, and Swift. I've used many frameworks including Rails, Laravel, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Django, Vue, Ember, Angular, CakePHP, Symphony, jQuery, and more.

HTML/CSS, SQL, Elasticsearch, MongoDB, Redis, AWS, Docker, Git, AI/ML APIs (OpenAI, Claude), payment processing (Stripe, PayPal), and various other integrations. Comfortable with architecture, UI/UX, database optimization, bash scripting, and general server admin tasks.

**I've delivered products and features** for startups of all sizes, from early-stage to acquisition. Notable projects include HelloSign (employee #2, acquired by Dropbox), Mattermark, and Groupthink.

**When I worked in advertising I built microsites and apps for high profile brands** including Exxon, Claritin, Oppenheimer, Allure, Hyatt, Plantronics, Paypal, LiveActive, Barilla, Triscuit, Charles Schwab, Clearasil, Volvo Cars North America, Lacoste, and Dos Equis.

**Excellent communication skills.** Happy to go into detail explaining options and limitations.

**Calm and collected** during crunch time.

Working remotely from Raleigh, NC.
