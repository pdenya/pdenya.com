I live and work in beautiful Cary, North Carolina. Since we moved in Summer 2016 my kids and I have enjoyed exploring Raleigh and Durham.

I built [PitchFriendly](http://www.pitchfriendly.com/) with Joel Andren in October 2013 to help startups manage their own PR. As PressFriendly itÂ [launched](http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/06/give-a-man-a-pitch-or-teach-a-man-to-pitch/) in February 2014 with a system that uses machine learning to decide which reporters should be pitched for a particular story. Since then the software has shifted into helping PR reps be more organized and efficient.

I worked at HelloSign at their nice office in SoMa. I spent my days coding in PHP and JavaScript with some occasional Objective-C when it was time for an update to the iOS app. I built some pretty cool things there like the first versions of HelloSign for Gmail and HelloSign for iOS.
